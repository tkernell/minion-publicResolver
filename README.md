# Minion Public Resolver
This is a specific use-case minion that allows Moloch DAO members to set and change a Minion-owned ENS domain content hash. The DAO can use this to approve changes to its website(s) and metadata.

Here is a [live demo](https://dterm-demo.glitch.me/?miniondemo). This requires Metamask. The demo is incorporated into another work-in-progress of mine, as you will see.
